In 1999, a group of students wanted to have a place to apply some of the things they were learning in their classes on campus, to learn things they were not getting in classes, to farm organically and to get their hands dirty with some hands-on farming experience. At the same time, Horticulture Professor John Biernbaum began researching possibilities for 4-season farming in Michigan. The marriage of these two projects became inevitable.
From the beginning, the aim of the farm was to provide a place where students could come and volunteer, work, visit, and have input on the development of the land and farm. As a result of the vision and hard work of many, the farm has flourished. Over the last 11 years the farm has developed into a place where many different groups are able to engage with growing food and creating learning opportunities through farming.

Daily circulation is approximately 18,000 print copies.

An interesting fact about The State News is that they sued Michigan State University in 2008 for issues they thought were violations of the Freedom of Information Act. 

The State News is solely student run and operated and there is no prior review of content before its publication. 

Many TSN alumns have gone off to hold impressive positions, some of which include CNN, Newsweek, the L.A. Times, and New York Times.

Currently there are about 45-50 employees that work in the newsroom. 

In addition to the newsroom, The State News also has its own student advertising, creative and distribution staffs." class="fancybox hide"></a>
