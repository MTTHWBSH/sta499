In 1999, a group of students wanted to have a place to apply some of the things they were learning in their classes on campus, to learn things they were not getting in classes, to farm organically and to get their hands dirty with some hands-on farming experience. At the same time, Horticulture Professor John Biernbaum began researching possibilities for 4-season farming in Michigan. The marriage of these two projects became inevitable.
From the beginning, the aim of the farm was to provide a place where students could come and volunteer, work, visit, and have input on the development of the land and farm. As a result of the vision and hard work of many, the farm has flourished. Over the last 11 years the farm has developed into a place where many different groups are able to engage with growing food and creating learning opportunities through farming.

by Kelly Salchow MacArthur
published in Designer Magazine, spring 2011

I have split my life between two passions—design and crew—for twenty years. I began rowing at age 14, and was hooked instantly. I felt an immediate connection to the water, and knew the sensation of gliding across the surface was something I would always love. Of course the initial attraction to the sport was just the beginning of a journey I could have never predicted. My interest grew into an unflinching commitment to training, and striving to reach my potential. I told myself I would keep pushing towards the next level in competition, until I plateaued or stopped enjoying it.

The thousands of miles rowed in shells, and stationary rowing machines led me to represent the USA in international competition for 8 years, 2 of these being the Olympic Games. By the time I retired from elite racing, my fellow national teammates had nicknamed me &#34;Grandma.&#34; It was time to pass the torch to the next generation. 

These days I meander down the river in a single, relishing every stroke, but without the anticipation of the next race on the horizon. My mind wanders through the amazing experiences the sport has brought me. The journey was not always fun, but it developed my skills, and my character.

A number of years ago, I realized that I lead a balanced life when I dedicate some part of each day to both rowing and design. The disciplines have influenced eachother, and I see many parallels to the paths followed in each pursuit. Below I consider the design process, as an athlete approaches training—each an opportunity to strive for excellence, challenge one's self, and go beyond the norm. As one of my national team coaches once asked, &#34;Who wants to settle for mediocrity?&#34; As you proceed, you could consider me one of your coaches, although I don't have a Ukranian accent, and I promise I won't make you do pull-ups from the limb of a huge tree.

You can hear the trickling of water and the purr of a car in the distance. We test the water and it is just as expected, ice cold. The current is strong enough to keep it clean of debris, but still has an orange tinge. After a rain it floods into the lower courtyards all along the banks. Many believe the Red Cedar will give you an extra limb if you step in, but myself and Nate chose to take the risk and dive right into the murky shallows. Inner tubes in hand, we step in. We sit down and let the current take us where it may. We float for a while taking in the trees and enjoying the laughs we get from other students. Once we decided we've had enough, we get out only to realize we have a long cold walk back to our shoes and shirts and of course, all of the classes have just gotten out." class="fancybox hide"></a>

There's a school that's known to all;
Its specialty is winning,
And those Spartans play good ball;
Spartan teams are never beaten,
All through the game they'll fight;
Fight for the only colors,
Green and White.

Go right through for MSU,
Watch the points keep growing.

Spartan teams are bound to win,
They're fighting with a vim.

Rah! Rah! Rah!

See their team is weakening,
We're going to win this game.

Fight! Fight! Rah! Team, Fight!

Victory for MSU." class="fancybox"><img src="assets/img/fightsong/thumb.png" alt="" /
